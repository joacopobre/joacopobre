## 🚀 About Me

- I’m passionate about coding, UX and software design.  
- I’m currently learning front-end development, JavaScript, React, and design patterns.  
- I’m working on projects that reinforce my skills in clean code principles, user-friendly UI/UX, and modular architecture.  
- I enjoy collecting and developing web projects that are both practical and visually engaging.

## 🧰 Featured Projects

Here are a few projects I’m proud of:

| Project | Description |
|---|---|
| **[Colour-Palette](https://github.com/joacopobre/Colour-Palette)** | A lightweight web tool that generates custom colour palettes using [TheColorAPI](https://www.thecolorapi.com/)—great for designers and developers. |
| **[Quizz-React-Project](https://github.com/joacopobre/Quizz-React-Project-)** | A React quiz app which pulls trivia questions from an API. A small but fun exercise in React hooks and API integration. |
| **[Components-Library](https://github.com/joacopobre/Components-Library)** | A React component collection (badges, banners, cards, testimonials) built using Vite, meant to support quick UI prototyping. |
| **[Movie-Watchlist](https://github.com/joacopobre/Movie-Watchlist)** | A simple watchlist app that allows users to search for films and keep track of ones they want to see. Built using vanilla JS and the OMDB API. |
